Thank you for viewing this project.

It should have been more simple, but I did learn alot and next time I believe I can execute many of these functions much more cleanly.

Lessons Taken:

One of the troubles I didn't notice I was having was with identity of lists and variable. I wish, during initial planning, I had implemented a UI element in order to better visualize the data flow.

Additionally, Much of my render and data-capture methods were smashed together, making it very difficult to finally create a functional app. 

My goal with this app was to use Local Storage, but I believe that at this juncture, I must move to a different project to execute this function. I spend a lot of time on this.

This was my first time attempting to create my own structure and data capture and implementing an ID system on my divs. I think many of the dom methods I used worked fairly well. 

So in summary:

-Plan Data Structure for Captured Data more thoroughly
-Plan flow of data through APP
-Decouple Rendering elements from Data Capture Elements
-Organize code better. VCM?

This all said, I believe this was a great excercise in the execution of vanilla JS code. I am ready to try something else now.
